# Cyber Project

This is the root directory for the CyberSafe project.

## Quick Start

You can run all npm commands from the root directory:

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run lint     # Run linter
npm run preview  # Preview production build
```

All commands automatically work from the root directory - no need to `cd` into `cybersafe`!

## Project Structure

- `cybersafe/` - The main React application
  - Built with Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
  - Contains the cybersecurity education platform

## Development

The project uses:
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling
- **React Router** for navigation

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

This will install dependencies in the `cybersafe` directory automatically.
